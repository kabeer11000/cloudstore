- [ ] Large datasets perform acceptably

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Network disconnections handled gracefully

- [ ] Malformed data rejected appropriately

#### Performance
- [ ] Large collections (1000+ documents) load efficiently
- [ ] Real-time updates remain responsive under load
- [ ] Memory usage stays stable during extended use
- [ ] Multiple browser tabs don't degrade performance

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Start MongoDB
mongod --dbpath /data/db

# Start Redis
redis-server

# Add test tenant to Redis
redis-cli SET "12" "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAE7S9jNNFeKXJaYcUh8FW6/FtOPsGqZNKaP8QANhOZwJYOGYEByAfGKzKhUAGVATVB/rE1bYXEQMD/DGOfPRdcMQ==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"

# Start CloudStore backend
cd source/backends/default
bun dev

# Start example app
cd example
bun dev
```

### 2. Connection Testing
1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Verify green "Connected" status
3. Open browser dev tools - no errors
4. Check network tab for successful WebSocket connection

### 3. Basic CRUD Testing
**Todo App:**
1. Add a new todo item
2. Edit an existing todo
3. Toggle completion status
4. Delete a todo item
5. Use filter buttons (All/Active/Completed)

**Full Demo:**
1. Add a new user with all fields
2. Update user status using toggle button
3. Delete a user
4. Try bulk operations

### 4. Query Testing
1. Add multiple users with different attributes
2. Use query builder to filter by:
   - Status (EQUAL)
   - Age (GREATER, LESSER)
   - Role (ARRAY.IN)
3. Verify results update in real-time
4. Remove filters and see full dataset

### 5. Real-time Testing
1. Open app in two browser windows
2. In window 1: Add a todo/user
3. In window 2: Verify it appears immediately
4. In window 2: Update the item
5. In window 1: Verify changes appear instantly

### 6. Error Scenario Testing
1. Stop the backend server
2. Try adding items - should show connection error
3. Restart server - should reconnect automatically
4. Try invalid operations - should show proper errors

### 7. Performance Testing
1. Add 100+ items rapidly
2. Verify UI remains responsive
3. Check browser memory usage in dev tools
4. Leave app running for 30+ minutes
5. Verify no memory leaks or degradation

## Expected Results

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All CRUD operations complete without errors
- ✅ Real-time updates work across multiple clients
- ✅ Authentication prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Error handling provides meaningful feedback
- ✅ Performance remains acceptable under normal load
- ✅ Code quality: No TypeScript errors, clean console
- ✅ Documentation: Complete and accurate API specs

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Connection time**: < 2 seconds to establish
- **CRUD operations**: < 500ms response time
- **Real-time updates**: < 100ms propagation delay
- **Memory usage**: Stable over extended sessions
- **Concurrent clients**: 10+ simultaneous users

### Error Handling Standards
- **Network errors**: Graceful degradation with retry
- **Validation errors**: Clear user-facing messages
- **Authentication errors**: Secure error responses
- **Database errors**: Logged server-side, user-friendly client messages

## Final Verification Commands

### Backend Health Check
```bash
# Check server logs for errors
tail -f source/backends/default/logs/server.log

# Verify database connections
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check Redis tenant data
redis-cli GET "12"
```

### Client Build Verification
```bash
# Build client without errors
cd source/client
bun run build

# Verify TypeScript compilation
tsc --noEmit

# Check for linting issues
bun run lint
```

### Example App Build
```bash
# Build example app
cd example
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview
```
